<h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>
	<p class="tab">Hello my name is Jakob Rhodes I'm 23 years old and have 3 brothers and two sisters. I enjoy video games, sports, and reading. I'm currently reading <i>The Stormlight Archive</i> by Brandon Sanderson. I'm loving the series so far and have just recently finshed the second book and am looking at where I can get the third one. Each one is about a thousand pages but I'm a fast reader and I can't put it down when I start reading. I'd have to say that my favorite book series is <i>The Wheel of Time</i> by Robert Jordan. I also enjoy playing all sorts of different video games with friends because friends alwas make things more fun and memorable. I also like to play sports with my brother Caleb whos a year younger than me. We'll often go to church ball or any other activity we can find because it's great exercise and fun. Looking forward to another exciting semester and doing my best to learn.</p>
